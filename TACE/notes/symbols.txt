symbols are stored on 64 bits numbers.

Starting from last bits:
- 2 bits not used
- 2 bits: kind of symbol
   0x00 = FUNCTION
   0x01 = PREDICATE
   0x11 = SPLITTING
- 4 bits : flags 
- 8 bits: arity
- rest: identifier

identifier = index in an association list with names.
(id, string)

Precedence:
 FUNCTION < SPLITTING < PREDICATE
and in each category, the symbols
are (linearly) ordered, increasingly,
by their order of declaration with new_symbol.
