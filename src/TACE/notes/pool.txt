Pool of clauses (not yet treated) 
= set called US in SPASS,
for selection of new candidate for resolution
(with worked clauses, called WO in SPASS).

Not tested for subsumption.

Store only:
- indices of the 2 clauses used to produce
this clause (by resolution)
- a code of the operation producing the clause
(resolution, resolution + e-splitting etc & simplification?)
- the size of the clause
  (for choosing the candidate of minimum size).
