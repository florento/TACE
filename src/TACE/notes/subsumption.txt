SPASS: subsumption of D by C

def.:
 does C subsumes D?
i.e. exists theta s.t. C theta subset D.

Rem.
NP-complete problem [Garay-Johnson 79]


Stillman algo [1973]:

 for each literal Ai of C,
    find Bj literal of D such that Ai sigma_i = Bj
    s.t. the Bj's are pairwise distinct
          and the sigma_i are compatible.


2 prefilters for tractability 
 
filter1:
size(C) leq size(D)

rem. the size is likely to be used for selection 
of clauses, hence can be stored in clauses
to avoid recomputation.
-> test almost for free.


filter2:
for every literal A in C, exists a literal A' of D s.t. A' = Asigma?
(test for existence of sigma's separately, without checking compatibility).
 rem.: test is PTIME

Rem.: [SPASS-HB]  
more than 95% of tests are rejected by the 2 filters (in that order).
