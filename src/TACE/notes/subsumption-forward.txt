SPASS, forward subsumption of C by N
where C (query) clause and N index of clauses.

def.:
 exists D in N such that D subsumes C?

for each atom A of C    (1)

 for each atom A' of N  (2)
 such that exists sigma, A = A'sigma

  for each clause D in N containing A'  (3)
   
   if D subsumes C then exit with 'yes'

(1) 'for' loop on the list of atoms
(2) lazy stream enumeration,
    with 'initialize' and 'next' functions of the module 'index'
(3) 'for' loop,
     on list returned by the module 'index'


Rem.: possibility to group loops (2) and (3)
into a lazy stream enumeration
(with a special 'initialize' function of nodule 'index').
